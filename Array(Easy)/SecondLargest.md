# Finding the Second-Largest Element in an Array

## Overview

The optimal approach to finding the second-largest element in an array involves iterating through the array and maintaining two variables (`largest` and `secondLargest`). This approach efficiently identifies the largest and second-largest elements in a single pass through the array.

## Algorithm Description

1. **Initialize two variables (`largest` and `secondLargest`).**
   - Initialize `largest` with the first element in the array.
   - Initialize `secondLargest` with a value that won't interfere with actual array elements.

```cpp
int largest = arr[0];
int secondLargest = INT_MIN; // A very small integer to initialize
```

2. **Iterate through the array and update `largest` and `secondLargest` as needed.**
   - If the current element is greater than `largest`, update both `largest` and `secondLargest`.
   - If the current element is greater than `secondLargest` and not equal to `largest`, update only `secondLargest`.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > largest) {
        secondLargest = largest;
        largest = arr[i];
    } else if (arr[i] > secondLargest && arr[i] != largest) {
        secondLargest = arr[i];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of finding the second-largest element using this optimal approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.

## Usage

To find the second-largest element in an array, use the provided optimal approach by initializing two variables (`largest` and `secondLargest`) and iterating through the array to update them.

## Example

Consider the array: [10, 5, 25, 8, 15]

```cpp
int largest = arr[0];
int secondLargest = INT_MIN;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > largest) {
        secondLargest = largest;
        largest = arr[i];
    } else if (arr[i] > secondLargest && arr[i] != largest) {
        secondLargest = arr[i];
    }
}

// At this point, 'secondLargest' contains the value 15
```

## Note

This optimal approach efficiently finds the second-largest element in an array by iterating through the array once and updating two variables. Adjustments can be made based on specific project needs.
